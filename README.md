# Java-Teaching-examples
These are unsorted java source codes I wrote while teaching students at the St. Paul American School in Shanghai China.
Naming Conventions:
  There are projects that are unusable or broken. Some on purpose (classwork for students was often to add some piece of code).
  This is just a guide to what I believe High School students can handle. 
  Although misplaced, these codes were given to students in the general order proposed by the book "Java Methods Object Oriented programming and data structures" By Maria Litvin and Gary Litvin.

Projects usually contain more than one code (same topic, different class periods/students).
Projects are usually named in according to the main concept of that class.
The review guides are most useful in seeing how the class was structured.
